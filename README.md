# Mario! Follow me
This is an Chrome extension which add one Mario in each webpage.
## How to install
1. Look for and click the green “<> Code” button on the right-hand side of the page.
2. In the dropdown, click the button "Download ZIP".
3. Take the downloaded ZIP file and extract it. We need to give it a permanent home because Chrome will externally load the files (if they get moved/deleted then the extension will stop working).
4. With the extension downloaded and extracted, we can now install it. In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions on the browser.
5. Turn on the switch "Developer Mode" on the right-hand side of the page.
6. Click the button "Load Unpacked" on the left and choose the extracted file.
